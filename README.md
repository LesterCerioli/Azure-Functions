# Azure Functions Development with .NET and Python

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for developing Azure Functions using both .NET and Python. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-driven code without having to manage infrastructure. We'll cover how to set up your environment, create and deploy functions, and test them locally.
